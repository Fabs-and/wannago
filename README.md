# Observations

It is an ongoing project. A campground for improvements. My first project, and where I apply everything I have learned, and I want to learn. Next steps are to make sure the app is stable enough to keep adding features, such as:

- Make it PWA
- Work with calendars, adding wannaGos to a calendar.
- Comments of people in wannaGos, where the creator of the plan can have an ongoing conversation with those who are attending the plan.
- I have a list with several small improvements that will make the app more userfriendly (improvements like Google authentication).

Please feel free to fork it and play with it, and if you feel so, make PRs.
